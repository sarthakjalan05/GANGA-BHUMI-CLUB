Link where the project is deployed:-"ganga-bhumi-club-jade.vercel.app"
For the database(If you have mongodb compass installed):-
Navigate to the path of the folder in your command prompt
After that create a local database on mongodb compass by the name of "gangabhumi"
Use the commands:-nodemon server.js(if nodemon path express mongoose are installed)
Then type in localhost:3022 in your browser and your project should be deployed on that and the data now will get stored

If these are not working directly run the index.html file to view the project.
I have the database on my local machine ready and working.
